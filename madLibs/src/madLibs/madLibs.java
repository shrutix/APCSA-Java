/*

    Once upon a time there was a __1p___ (boy/girl) living in the mystical ___2a____ (forest/mountains) of Itty Bitty Boo. Their name was ____3b___ (name) and was ___4c_ (age) years old . _____5d__ (He/She/They) lived in solitary in the confines of their _____6e____ (dream home). Even though ___3b__ (repeat name) got lonely at times, ____7f___ (he/she/they) spent lots of time ___8g___ (hobby). At least __calc j_____ (number) hours a day was spent ____8g__ (repeat hobby). Finally __3b__ (repeat name) decided that solitary living was boring and set out to find some friends. While strolling through the ___2a__ (repeat forest/mountains), ___11k___ (he/she/they) found a ____12l___ (adjective) _____13m_____ (light/sound). After following that, ___14n___ (he/she/they) found a large group of ___15o___ (adjective) talking ___16q___ (animals). At first ___17r___ (he/she/they) was ___18s___ (adjective past tense), but then realized that they could be new friends of ____19t_____ (hers/his/theirs). Quietly watching the ___16q___ (repeat animals) at first, ____20u____ (name) then came out from the shadows but accidentally stepped on a ____21v____ (object) which made a loud ___22w___ (noise). The ___16q___ (repeat animals) quickly turned around and dropped all their ___ 23x____ (objects). There were at least ___24y___ (number) of them. ___25z___ (name) introduced ____26aa___ (herself/himself/themselves) to them. The ___16q___ (repeat animals) ___27bb___ (adverb) became friends with ____28cc____ (her/him/them) and ran to the ____29dd____ (place) together. They all lived ____30ee___ (adverb) ever after together with ___31ff___ (number) more animals.
